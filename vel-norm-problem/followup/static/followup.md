1. In your report, page 8, eq. (12), there seems to be a minor typo (missing "+" for one of the terms). You will also notice that the $a_T$ parameter arising within the $w_{2p}(\phi)$ term can also be substituted in terms of $\beta^2$. Thus, everything on the RHS of eq. (12) will be functions of $\phi$ and $\beta$ (your $k$ parameter is just a placeholder for $\phi$). You will also note that $\sin(2k)$ equals $\cos(2\phi)$ (simple trig identities); likewise, the $2\sin^2(k)$ term from $w_{3p}$ can be replaced by $(1-\cos(2k))$ and further, $\cos(2k) = -\sin(2\phi)$. All this will lead to a cleaner looking expression for $w_p(\phi)$ entirely expressed in terms of $\phi$ and $\beta^2$.

2. Using your results from part~(b) before (pages 12-13, for a given value of $\beta$, numerically evaluate the value of $\phi=\phi_m$ such that $y_p(\phi_m)=0$. Next, define $\delta=1/\beta^2$ and using an interval $\delta\in(0.001,1)$, compute $\phi_m$ such that $y_p(\phi_m)=0$. Express these results in a plot of $\phi_m$ versus $\delta$. Qualitatively speaking, as a$_T\rightarrow 0$ (vanishingly small thrust magnitude), $\beta\rightarrow\infty$, and accordingly, $\delta\rightarrow 0$. Conversely, $\delta\rightarrow 1$ implies $\beta^2\rightarrow 1$ which indicates the maximum allowed thrust acceleration that maintains prograde motion. You will also note that $y_p$ has the physical meaning of radial velocity and thus, when $y_p$ becomes zero, the orbit reaches maximum altitude. Accordingly, if you evaluate $w_p(\phi_m)$ (i.e., the flight direction angle), it should be exactly unity (up to numerical error). That will be a good sanity check. 

2. Using the same interval $\delta\in(0.001,1)$, compute $\phi_m$ that minimizes $w_p(\phi)$. Generate a plot of $\phi_m$ versus $\delta$.
